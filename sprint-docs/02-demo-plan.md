# Bookit Sprint #2: Demo (proposed)
April 11, 2017

We intend to demonstrate two user stories this week: Booking a room and Logging in.


## Booking a room

1) Open the Bookit web app. See the agenda view, set to today's date, showing meetings for all rooms.
2) Click on an available space.
3) See the room booking form appear on the left, pre-populated with the correct time and date.
4) Add a meeting title.
5) Click "Bookit".
6) See the booking appear in Bookit and in the Outlook calendar.


## Logging in

1) Go to the Bookit web app and see a login screen.
2) Enter credentials (email and password). Click "Login".
3) See the agenda view. 
  - My name is displayed the upper right corner.
  - Meetings I own are marked as such.
